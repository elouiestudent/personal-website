            "I enjoy crafting code that have a tangible impact on our everyday lives, whether that be mobile or web applications, machine learning models, or anything in between. I’m always on the lookout for new technologies, especially those in the field of artificial intelligence.",
            "I’m currently looking for SWE internships in Winter 2020 and Summer 2021.",
            "When I’m not in front of the computer, you can find me swimming in a nearby pool, drawing in my sketchbook, or curled up on the couch with a book."
